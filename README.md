Scripts created here rely on Carbon Black Response API
Comprehensive guide to setting this up can be seen at:
https://cbapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Can summarise for you, to run scripts here you need to:
1. Install Python 
2. Install cbapi - pip install cbapi
3. Grab the API key from the console and then run: cbapi-response configure 
  (in windows you will need to go into the directory eg c:\python27\scripts\cbapi-response)
4. Run the scripts with caution!  

Thanks to Red Canary, reviewing their scripts helped understand how the API can work. 
Some of the offical Carbon Black Response scripts seem decent but havent been updated since 2015
