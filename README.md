Scripts created here rely on Carbon Black Response API.
Comprehensive guide to setting this up can be seen at:
https://cbapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To summarise, to run scripts here you need to:
1. Install Python 
2. Install cbapi - pip install cbapi
3. Grab the API key from cbr web console
4. run: cbapi-response configure 
  (in windows you will need to go into the python directory then \scripts\cbapi-response)
5. Use the scripts with caution!  

Thanks to Red Canary, reviewing their scripts helped understand how the API can work. 
Some of the official Carbon Black Response scripts seem decent but havent been updated since 2015 and found some of them not to work
